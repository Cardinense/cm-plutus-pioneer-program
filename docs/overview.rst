Overview
========

These are my notes from the `series of videos by Lars Br√ºnjes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program>`_ for the Plutus Pioneers Program.

I have tried to transcribe as closely as possible to the source material. I hope that this will complement the videos.

Once I have all the videos transcribed, I'll go back and fix all the typos and other errors I have made. Please feel free to issue pull requests for updates and corrections, no matter how trivial. I promise you
that I am not precious about being corrected.

.. note::
    The Plutus Pioneer lectures were created at a time when Plutus was going through rapid development. As a result, earlier lectures rely on earlier versions of the Plutus
    code. Once Plutus has settled into a stable form, I will update all these notes to reflect this, and will make sure to highlight the differences between the video 
    lectures and these written notes.

Once I've worked my way through the Pioneer lectures, I will be adding to the documentation here to show how I wrote my chess program in Haskell, which, hopefully, can act
as a further resource for Haskell learning for those who want to dive deeper into this wonderful language.

If you find this helpful, and you fancy helping out a small Cardano Stake Pool, please consider staking a little of your ADA with CHESS https://chess.ihpapp.com, 
or any of the many other small pools run by single stake pool operators.
