Week 08 - Property Based Testing
================================

.. note::
    This is a written version of `Lecture
    #8 <https://youtu.be/JMRwkMgaBOg>`__.

    In this lecture we cover another state machine example, automatic testing using emulator traces, optics, and property-based testing.

    This week we were using Plutus commit 530cc134364ae186f39fb2b54239fb7c5e2986e9, the same commit as we used in the last lecture.

Introduction
------------

In the last lecture we looked at state machines, and saw how they often allow us to write much less code to express the logic of a smart contract, partly because  
there is a lot of sharing between on-chain and off-chain code and partly because a lot of boilerplate is encapsulated in the state machine machinery.

In this lecture we will see another example using a state machine, because the concept is very important. We will also take a look at testing. 
First we will look at the code, then we will explore various ways to go about testing.
