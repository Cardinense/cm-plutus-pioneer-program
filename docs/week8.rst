Week 08 - Property Based Testing
================================

.. note::
    This is a written version of `Lecture
    #8 <https://youtu.be/JMRwkMgaBOg>`__.

    In this lecture we cover another state machine example, automatic testing using emulator traces, optics, and property-based testing.

    This week we were using Plutus commit 530cc134364ae186f39fb2b54239fb7c5e2986e9, the same commit as we used in the last lecture.
