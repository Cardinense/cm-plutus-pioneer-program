Overview
========

These are my notes from the `series of videos by Lars Br√ºnjes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program>`_ for the Plutus Pioneers Program.

I have tried to transcribe as closely as possible to the source material. I hope that this will complement to videos.

Once I have all the videos transcribed, I'll go back and fix all the typos and other errors I have made. Please issue pull requests for updates and corrections, no matter how trivial.

If you find this helpful, and you fancy helping out a small Cardano Stake Pool, please consider staking a little of your ADA with CHESS https://chess.ihpapp.com, or any of the many other small pools run by single stake pool operators.
