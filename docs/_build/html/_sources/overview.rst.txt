Overview
========

These are my notes from the `series of videos by Lars Br√ºnjes <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program>`_ for the Plutus Pioneers Program.

I have tried to transcribe as closely as possible to the source material. I hope that this will complement the videos.

The source code for the lectures can be found `here <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program/tree/main/code>`_.

.. note::
    The Plutus Pioneer lectures were created at a time when Plutus was going through rapid development. As a result, earlier lectures rely on earlier versions of the Plutus
    code. Once Plutus has settled into a stable form, I will update all these notes to reflect this, and will make sure to highlight the differences between the video 
    lectures and these written notes.
