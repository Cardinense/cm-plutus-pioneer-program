Week 07 - State Machines
========================

.. note::
    This is a written version of `Lecture
    #7 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJupInqvJUI>`__.

    It covers commit schemes and state machines.

Overview
--------

In this lecture we will look at state machines. State machines can be very useful to shorter and more concise contracts, both on-chain and off-chain. There is higher level support for state machines in the Plutus libraries that builds on top of the lower level mechanisms we have seen so far.

As a running example, we are going to implement a little game, played between Alice and Bob. It's a bit like Rock, Paper, Scissors, but even simpler, because there are 
only two options.

Alice and Bob both have two options, they can either play 0 or 1.
